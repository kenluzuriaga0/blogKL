I began my career as a project assistant at university, gaining experience in some corporate areas. I also acquired skills in hardware and operating systems through technical support. Transitioning to development, I utilized Java to create web applications and program ERP modules. Currently, I work remotely, enhancing my Python skills and learning about Accounting and business processes.
